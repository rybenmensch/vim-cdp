USAGE:
distort pulsed
1 infil outfil env stime dur frq frand trand arand transp tranrand [-s -e]
OR
2-3 inf outf env stime dur frq frand trand arand cyctime transp tranrand [-s -e]
    Impose impulse-train on source (mode 1), OR
    Use segment of src as looped content of synthetic impulse-train(modes 2,3).
ENV        brkpnt envelope of impulse. Will be scaled to duration needed.
STIME      time in src sound where impulses begin.(In mode 3,time as samplecnt)
DUR        time for which impulses persist.
FRQ        frequency of the impulses, in Hz: range 0.1 to 50
FRAND      randomisation of frequency of impulse (in semitones) (range 0-12).
TRAND      randomisation of relative time-positions of amp peaks & troughs
           from impulse to impulse. (range 0 - 1)
ARAND      randomisation of amplitude shape created by peaks & troughs
           from impulse to impulse. (range 0 - 1)
CYCTIME    duration of wavecycles to grab for sound inside impulses (mode 2)
           OR number of wavecycles to grab as sound inside impulses (mode 3)
TRANSP     transposition contour of sound inside each impulse. Brkpnt file of
           time:semitone-shift pairs,(time will be scaled to impulse dur),
TRANRAND   randomisation transp contour from impulse to impulse.(Range 0-1)
-s         keep start of src sound, before impulses begin (if any).
-e         keep end of src sound, after impulses end (if any)
Works on MONO files only
