TIMESTRETCH FILE BY REPEATING 'WAVECYCLES' (BELOW SPECIFIED FRQ)

MULTIPLIER: (integer) is no. of times each wavecycle(grp) repeats.
CYCLECNT:   (integer) is no. wavecycles in repeated groups.
SKIPCYCLES: (integer) is no. of wavecycles to skip at start of file
HILIM:      (float)   is frq below which cycles are counted.

multiplier and cyclecnt may vary over time.

Works on MONO files only
