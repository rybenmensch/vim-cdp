USAGE:
distort envel 1-2 infile outfile         cyclecnt [-ttroughing] [-eexponent]
distort envel 3   infile outfile         cyclecnt troughing     [-eexponent]
distort envel 4   infile outfile envfile cyclecnt 

IMPOSE ENVELOPE OVER EACH GROUP OF cyclecnt 'WAVECYCLES'

MODES (Works on MONO files only)-
1  rising envelope.
2  falling envelope.
3  troughed envelope.
4  user defined envelope.
CYCLECNT  is no of wavecycles under a single envelope.
EXPONENT  is exponent for envelope rise or decay:
          If OMMITED envelope rise/decay is linear.
TROUGHING is trough of envelope (0-1: default 0).
ENVFILE   Defines user envelope as time/val(0-1) pairs.
          (Time units arbitrary, as envelope stretched to each cycle(set) duration.

CYCLECNT, TROUGHING and EXPONENT, may vary over time
