PITCHWARP 'WAVECYCLES' OF SOUND.

octvary:    max possible transposition (up or down) in octaves.
            Range(>0 - 8.0)
            pitch of each wavecycle is varied by a random amount
            within the range octvary 8vas up to octvary 8vas down.
cylelen:    Max no. cycles possible between generation of transpos vals(>1)
            (Default : 64)
            Actual cyclecnt is a random number, less than this maximum.
skipcycles: No of cycles to skip at start of file.

cyclelen and octvary may vary over time.

Works on MONO files only
