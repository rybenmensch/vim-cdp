USAGE:
distort overload 1 infile outfile clip_level depth
OR
distort overload 2 infile outfile gate depth freq

Clip the signal with noise or a (possibly timevarying) waveform.

clip_level: Level at which the signal is clipped.
            Range(0 - 1)
depth:      Depth of distortion pattern on clipped stretches of signal.
            (Range 0 - 1)
freq:       Frequency of waveform imposed on clipped stretches of signal.

clip_level, depth and freq may vary over time.
